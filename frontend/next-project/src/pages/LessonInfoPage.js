            Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without
            being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning
            has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition,
            effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the
            human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you
            probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many
            researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards
            human-level AI.
